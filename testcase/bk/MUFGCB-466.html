Unfortunately, without the actual MUFGCB-466 document, I cannot analyze its content or generate a UAT test case table based on it. However, I can provide a general HTML template for the UAT test case table based on the categories and instructions given:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>No</th>
    <th>Pre-Requirements</th>
    <th>Use-Case</th>
    <th>Expected Result</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td><!-- Describe any pre-requisites or initial conditions for this test case --></td>
    <td><!-- Describe the use-case or operation steps based on the Mockup Screen and Gap Description --></td>
    <td><!-- Describe the expected outcome that aligns with MUFG's requirements after implementing the new function --></td>
  </tr>
  <!-- Add more rows for additional test cases as needed -->
</table>

For each row in the table:

- The "No" column should have a unique test case number.
- The "Pre-Requirements" column should list any prerequisites or initial conditions necessary for that test case.
- The "Use-Case" column should describe the specific operation steps, new functions, or console interactions based on the Mockup Screen and Gap Description sections of the MUFGCB-466 document.
- The "Expected Result" column should outline the expected outcome that aligns with MUFG's business requirements after implementing the new function or functionality.

Please note that without access to the MUFGCB-466 document, I cannot provide specific details for each test case. However, I hope this HTML template and instructions are helpful in structuring the UAT test case table once you have the necessary document content.
