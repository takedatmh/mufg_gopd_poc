Unfortunately, based on the provided documents, I could not find enough information to generate a comprehensive UAT test case table for the HLSD-HKCB-3245 requirement. The document mainly provides a high-level overview of the requirement but does not contain specific details about the T24 console operations, mockup screens, or expected results needed to create detailed test cases.

However, I can provide a basic structure of the UAT test case table based on the limited information available:

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" style="border-collapse: collapse; border-color: pink;">
  <tr>
    <th>No.</th>
    <th>Pre-Requirements</th>
    <th>Use-Case</th>
    <th>Expected Result</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>T24 should not have the following fields:
      <ul>
        <li>Stop Accruals</li>
        <li>Withholding Tax Rate Paid by Lender</li>
        <li>Withholding Tax Rate Paid by Borrower</li>
        <li>Taxable</li>
        <li>Early Repayment</li>
        <li>Earliest Date</li>
        <li>Notice Days</li>
        <li>LOC</li>
        <li>Correspondence</li>
        <li>Commodity</li>
        <li>Reschedule</li>
        <li>Participation</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>Ensure that the above fields are available in T24 on Loan disbursement and Loan amendment screens.</td>
    <td>The specified fields should be visible and editable on the relevant T24 screens, allowing users to input and update the required information.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Please note that this is a very basic test case based on the limited information provided in the document. To create more comprehensive and detailed test cases, additional information regarding specific T24 console operations, mockup screens, and expected results would be required.
